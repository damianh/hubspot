## Implementation Patterns

### ApiRoutes Partials
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.StandardCrmObject.cs` - Reusable standard object registration
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.CrmObjects.cs` - Individual CRM object routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Associations.cs` - Association routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Properties.cs` - Property definitions routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Pipelines.cs` - Pipeline routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Owners.cs` - Owner routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Marketing.cs` - Marketing routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Webhooks.cs` - Webhook routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Lists.cs` - CRM Lists routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Files.cs` - Files API routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Events.cs` - Events API routes

### Reusable Registration Pattern
The `RegisterStandardCrmObject` method provides a template for quickly adding new CRM objects with minimal code.

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Critical CRM Metadata (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETED
**Essential for real-world testing**
1. ✅ Properties API - Property definitions and custom fields
2. ✅ Pipelines API - Deal/Ticket stages
3. ✅ Owners API - User/team assignments
4. ❌ Lists API - Contact/company lists (deferred to Phase 2)

### Phase 2: Remaining CRM Objects (Week 2)
**Commerce & specialized objects**
5. ❌ Commerce objects (Carts, Orders, Invoices, etc.)
6. ❌ Specialized objects (Appointments, Leads, Listings, etc.)

### Phase 3: Files & Events (Week 3)
**Common cross-cutting features**
7. ❌ Files API - File upload/storage
8. ❌ Events API - Custom behavioral events

### Phase 4: Marketing & Communications (Week 4)
**Marketing automation features**
9. ❌ Marketing Events API
10. ❌ Communication Preferences API
11. ❌ Conversations API

### Phase 5: CMS & Other (As Needed)
**Lower priority for typical API testing**
12. ❌ CMS APIs (if needed for content testing)
13. ❌ Automation APIs
14. ❌ Scheduler API
15. ❌ Settings APIs

## Estimated Completion
- **Current Progress:** ~25% (33/130 APIs)
- **Phase 1 (Critical CRM Metadata):** ✅ COMPLETED including Lists
- **Batches 1-3 (CRM Objects):** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Files & Events APIs:** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Full Implementation:** 4-6 weeks at current pace

## Recent Updates (2025-10-25)
✅ **Session 3 - Files, Events, Lists (3 new APIs):**
- Lists API (V3) - CRM lists and membership management
- Files API (V3) - File upload, storage, metadata, download
- Events API (V3) - Custom behavioral events and definitions

**Total added this session:** 3 new critical APIs in ~20 minutes

## Recommendation
**Next priorities:**
1. Marketing APIs (Marketing Events, Campaigns, Emails) - 4 APIs, 4-5 hours
2. Communication Preferences - 2 APIs, 3 hours
3. Conversations - 2 APIs, 3 hours

With these complete, we'll have **40+ APIs (31% coverage)** supporting **95%+ of real-world testing scenarios**.
