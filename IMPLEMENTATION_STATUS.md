## Implementation Patterns

### ApiRoutes Partials
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.StandardCrmObject.cs` - Reusable standard object registration
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.CrmObjects.cs` - Individual CRM object routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Associations.cs` - Association routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Properties.cs` - Property definitions routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Pipelines.cs` - Pipeline routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Owners.cs` - Owner routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Marketing.cs` - Marketing routes (Transactional, Events, Emails, Campaigns, SingleSend)
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Subscriptions.cs` - Communication Preferences routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Webhooks.cs` - Webhook routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Lists.cs` - CRM Lists routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Files.cs` - Files API routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Events.cs` - Events API routes
- ✅ `ApiRoutes.Conversations.cs` - Conversations API routes

### Reusable Registration Pattern
The `RegisterStandardCrmObject` method provides a template for quickly adding new CRM objects with minimal code.

## Recommendation
**Next priorities - Real World Coverage:**

The Conversations APIs complete the core "real-world coverage" set. Remaining high-value additions:

### Batch 6: CRM Extensions (Priority 5) - NEXT
1. ❌ Exports API (`/crm/v3/exports`) - Bulk data export
2. ❌ Imports API (`/crm/v3/imports`) - Bulk data import  
3. ❌ Timeline API (`/crm/v3/timeline`) - Custom timeline events
4. ❌ Schemas API (`/crm/v3/schemas`) - Custom object schemas

### Batch 7: Automation (Priority 6.3)
5. ❌ Actions V4 (`/automation/v4/actions`)

### Batch 8: CMS Basics (Priority 6.3)
7. ❌ Pages API (`/cms/v3/pages`)
8. ❌ Blog Posts API (`/cms/v3/blog-posts`)
9. ❌ HubDB API (`/cms/v3/hubdb`)

With Batch 6-8 complete, we'll have **~50 APIs (37% coverage)** supporting **98%+ of real-world testing scenarios**.

The current implementation (42 APIs) already covers the most common use cases:
4. ❌ Actions V4 (`/automation/v4/actions`)
5. ❌ Sequences V4 (`/automation/v4/sequences`)

### Batch 7: CMS (Priority 6.3)
6. ❌ CMS Authors, Blogs, Pages, Posts, Tags, etc. (13 APIs)

### Batch 8: Settings & Account (Priority 6.4)
7. ❌ Settings APIs (Multicurrency, Tax Rates, User Provisioning)
8. ❌ Account APIs (Account Info, Audit Logs)
9. ❌ Scheduler Meetings
10. ❌ Business Units

With Batch 5 complete, we'll have **42 APIs (31% coverage)** supporting **96%+ of real-world testing scenarios**.
