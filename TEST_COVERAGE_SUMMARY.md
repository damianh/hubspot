## Next Steps for Test Implementation

### Priority 1: Fix Failing Tests in New Files

   - Implement Association V4 batch endpoints
   - Fix Owners get by ID

2. **Fix Lists API**
   - Implement all CRUD operations
   - Implement membership management
   - Fix response formats

3. **Fix Events API**
   - Implement send event endpoint
   - Implement batch send
   - Implement custom events

4. **Fix Files Upload**
   - Fix multipart form data handling
   - Implement update endpoint

5. **Fix CRM Extensions**

   - Fix Imports create/get/cancel
   - Fix Timeline templates

### Priority 2: Add Tests for Untested APIs

1. **Additional CRM Objects** (35+ objects)
   - Create comprehensive tests for all standard objects
   - Test batch operations
   - Test search/filter capabilities

2. **Business Units API**
3. **Automation API**
4. **CMS API**
5. **Account API**
6. **Settings API**

   - Test rate limiting

2. **Pagination**
   - Test large result sets
   - Test cursor-based pagination

3. **Filtering & Search**
   - Complex filter scenarios
   - Search across multiple properties

4. **Performance**
   - Concurrent requests
   - Batch operation limits

## Test Quality Metrics

### Code Coverage
- Mock Server Core: High (most APIs registered)
- Repository Layer: Medium (core objects covered)
- API Routes: Medium (standard operations covered)

### Test Patterns
- ✅ Using Kiota-generated clients (strong typing)
- ✅ Using raw HttpClient for flexibility
- ✅ Following AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- ✅ Proper async/await usage
- ✅ IAsyncLifetime for setup/teardown

### Areas for Improvement
- Add more edge case testing
- Add more validation error testing
- Add integration tests across multiple APIs
- Add performance benchmarks

## Notes

- All tests use the actual Kiota-generated clients when available
- Tests validate both the mock server implementation and client behavior
- The mock server successfully mimics HubSpot API behavior for supported endpoints
- Multi-version support (V3, V202509) is working well
- Batch operations are well-supported in tested areas
