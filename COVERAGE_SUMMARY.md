# Test Coverage Summary - MockServer Completeness

## Current Situation

**Test Coverage for Kiota-Generated Clients: Low**

This indicates:
1. **MockServer has incomplete API coverage** - Many endpoints aren't implemented yet
2. **Generated client methods are untested** - Client code paths haven't been exercised
3. **Integration gaps** - The MockServer doesn't fully mirror the real HubSpot API

## Purpose of Testing Generated Clients

The generated Kiota clients should be tested to ensure:
- **All client methods work against MockServer** - Every API call succeeds
- **Request/response handling is correct** - Serialization works properly
- **Full API coverage** - MockServer implements all endpoints that clients can call
- **Integration validation** - Complete workflows execute successfully

Low coverage means missing MockServer implementations, not a problem with the approach.

## What's Been Created

### 1. Test Coverage Strategy (`TEST_COVERAGE_STRATEGY.md`)
- Complete strategy for achieving full MockServer/Client integration
- Step-by-step guide for adding new API support
- Priority-ranked list of APIs to implement
- Example implementations

### 2. Test Coverage Plan (`TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md`)
- Detailed testing patterns and templates
- Identifies which APIs need MockServer implementations
- Provides test code examples

### 3. Coverage Analysis Script (`analyze-test-coverage.ps1`)
- Analyzes which APIs have MockServer implementations
- Shows priority-ranked list of missing APIs
- Tracks progress toward full coverage
- Run with: `.\analyze-test-coverage.ps1`

### 4. Updated Test Project
- Added `coverlet.msbuild` package for coverage collection
- Ready for detailed coverage reporting

## Recommended Approach

### Increase Coverage by Adding MockServer Support

The coverage is low because many API endpoints aren't implemented in MockServer yet. To increase coverage:

**Step 1: Identify Missing APIs**
```bash
.\analyze-test-coverage.ps1
```

**Step 2: For each untested API:**
1. Create repository in `Repositories/{ApiName}/`
2. Add route handlers in `Routes/ApiRoutes.{ApiName}.cs`
3. Register in `HubSpotMockServer.cs`
4. Write integration tests

**Step 3: Verify Coverage Increased**
```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

### Priority Order

Focus on implementing MockServer support for:

1. **Core CRM Objects** (Tickets, Products, Quotes, Invoices)
   - High usage in real applications
   - Many existing tests to learn from

2. **CMS APIs** (Pages, Domains, HubDB, Tags)
   - Content management is a key HubSpot feature
   - Relatively straightforward to implement

3. **Marketing APIs** (Marketing Events, Campaigns, Forms)
   - Important for marketing automation
   - Complex workflows to test

4. **Additional Objects** (Calls, Emails, Meetings, Tasks, Notes)
   - Activity tracking objects
   - Similar patterns to existing implementations

## Quick Wins

### 1. Add MockServer Support for Top 10 Missing APIs

Pick from this list based on `analyze-test-coverage.ps1` output:
- CRM Tickets
- CRM Products  
- CRM Quotes
- CMS Pages
- CMS Domains
- HubDB Tables
- Marketing Events
- Forms
- Workflows
- Custom Objects

### 2. Use Existing Patterns

Copy patterns from well-tested APIs:
- **CRM Objects**: Use `CrmContactsTests.cs` as template
- **CMS Content**: Use `CmsAdvancedTests.cs` patterns
- **Lists & Search**: See `ListsFilesEventsTests.cs`

### 3. Implement Complete CRUD

For each API, implement:
- Create (POST)
- Read by ID (GET /{id})
- List/Search (GET with query params)
- Update (PATCH)
- Delete (DELETE)
- Batch operations (POST /batch/{operation})

### 4. Track Progress

After each API implementation:
```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
.\analyze-test-coverage.ps1
```

Watch coverage percentage increase!

## Expected Results

As you add MockServer implementations:
- **Coverage increases gradually** - Each new API adds 1-2% coverage
- **Generated client code gets exercised** - Client methods are called by tests
- **Integration validated** - Clients work correctly with MockServer
- **Target: 80%+ coverage** - When most major APIs are implemented

Current: ~20% (rough estimate)
After 10 APIs: ~40%
After 30 APIs: ~65%
After all major APIs: ~80%

## How Coverage Relates to MockServer Completeness

**Coverage %** directly reflects **MockServer API Implementation %**:
- Low coverage = Many API endpoints missing from MockServer
- High coverage = MockServer implements most/all API endpoints
- 100% coverage = Every generated client method successfully calls MockServer

## Common Questions

### Q: Why is Kiota-generated client coverage low?
**A:** Because the MockServer doesn't implement all the API endpoints yet. Many client methods have never been called in tests because their corresponding MockServer endpoints don't exist.

### Q: How do I increase coverage?
**A:** Implement more API endpoints in MockServer and write tests that call them. Each new API implementation will increase coverage.

### Q: Should I test the generated client code?
**A:** Yes! That's the whole point. The tests verify that:
1. The generated clients can call the MockServer successfully
2. Request/response serialization works
3. The MockServer correctly implements the HubSpot API contract

### Q: What coverage percentage should I target?
**A:** 
- Short term: 50% (core CRM + CMS APIs)
- Medium term: 70% (add Marketing, Automation)
- Long term: 80%+ (comprehensive API coverage)

### Q: How long will it take to reach 80% coverage?
**A:**
- Each API takes ~2-4 hours (repository + routes + tests)
- Need ~50-60 APIs for 80% coverage  
- At 2 APIs/week: ~6 months
- At 5 APIs/week: ~2.5 months

## Next Actions

1. ✅ Run analysis: `.\analyze-test-coverage.ps1`
2. ⬜ Review `TEST_COVERAGE_STRATEGY.md` for implementation guide
3. ⬜ Pick top 3 missing APIs from analysis output
4. ⬜ For each API:
   - Create repository in `Repositories/{ApiName}/`
   - Add routes in `Routes/ApiRoutes.{ApiName}.cs`  
   - Register in `HubSpotMockServer.cs`
   - Write tests in `test/HubSpot.Tests/MockServer/`
5. ⬜ Run coverage: `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`
6. ⬜ Verify coverage increased
7. ⬜ Repeat until target coverage reached
