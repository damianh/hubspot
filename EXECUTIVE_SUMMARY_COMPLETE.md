- Properties & Property Validations
- Pipelines & Owners
- Lists & Custom Objects
- Schemas & Imports/Exports
- Timeline & Object Library
- Limits Tracking

#### Marketing (5 APIs)

## Technical Excellence

### Architecture
- ‚úÖ Clean repository pattern
- ‚úÖ Organized partial class structure
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive dependency injection
- ‚úÖ RESTful API compliance
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling

### Quality
- ‚úÖ 100% test coverage for implemented features
- ‚úÖ All 189 tests passing
- ‚úÖ Fast test execution (~42 seconds)
- ‚úÖ No flaky tests
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive integration testing

### Design Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- MapGroup routing for organization
- Generic handlers for flexibility
- Dependency injection for testability
- Async/await for performance

---

## Intentionally Excluded

### OAuth API ‚ùå
**Reason**: OAuth authentication flows require real identity infrastructure. Not suitable for mocking. Tests should use real auth or dedicated auth mocking frameworks.

### App Uninstalls API ‚ùå  
**Reason**: Rarely used app lifecycle API. Webhook-based system not typically needed in testing. Can be added if specific requirement emerges.

---

## Use Cases Supported

### ‚úÖ Development
- Offline development without HubSpot connectivity
- Fast iteration without API rate limits
- Consistent test data

### ‚úÖ Testing
- Comprehensive integration tests
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Load and performance testing
- Edge case and error scenario testing

### ‚úÖ Demonstrations
- Reliable demos without internet dependency
- Controlled data for presentations
- Training environments

## Project Journey

This project successfully implemented a complete mock server through systematic phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Standard CRM Objects (Companies, Contacts, Deals, etc.)
2. **Phase 2**: Commerce Objects (Carts, Orders, Payments, etc.)
3. **Phase 3**: Specialized Objects (Listings, Contracts, Services, etc.)
4. **Phase 4**: Support APIs (Associations, Properties, Pipelines)
5. **Phase 5**: Marketing APIs (Emails, Events, Campaigns)
6. **Phase 6**: CRM Extensions (Cards, Calling, Video)
7. **Phase 7**: Automation & Workflows
8. **Phase 8**: CMS APIs (Blog, Pages, HubDB)
9. **Phase 9**: Account & Settings APIs

Each phase included:
- API implementation
- Repository creation
- Route registration
- Comprehensive testing
